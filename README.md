Just stepped out. I’m still unpeeling the layers of Last Bullet like you peel an orange, but the juice is somehow trying to escape faster. I’m telling you, the theater was a battleground of nacho cheese and overly aggressive Dolby surround sound.

Last Bullet — so, so intense. The gunshots felt like they were firing out of the screen, and somewhere in there—I think I dropped half of my popcorn. The lead actor, Coleman? Man, it’s like he was carrying the weight of the world’s disappointments in his eyes. Especially when he took out that villain… was it the parking lot scene or in that dusty, weird tunnel? My memory’s probably got holes.

> The funny part? I almost tripped down the sticky stairs because my mind was still stuck on the way they pulled off that car chase. Like, how can they loop the loop like a rollercoaster in a horror house? It’s like that one time I saw a cat chasing its own tail, but with more drama.

Oh, also, they kept zooming in on this old pocket 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 which, idk, made me feel my Age creeping up, like it was ticking through lost yesterdays. And ugh, my back is starting to complain from sitting through the entire thing, but who cares! I’d 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to pause and adopt that dog from scene 12. Absolute star, begging to be loved. Who even remembers what happened in scene 12, come to think of it?

𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , if only to see the part where the universe suddenly tips over, upside down, and I swear the screen felt like it was melting my eyeballs. Did you hear about it, with the score just pouring over like honey? That’s not even the loud, erratic woman spilling her drink (or her soul?) two aisles down. She’d probably also 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , lol.

Caffeine-𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 energy drink of a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮. It makes no sense and yet feels like standing in the middle of a tornado wielding a banana as a weapon. Genius! My head’s still spinning.

```C
int main() {
  printf(“Whoops, wrong tab”);
  return Error;
